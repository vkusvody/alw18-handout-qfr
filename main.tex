\section[Introduction]{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In this talk, we give the preliminary results of our typological survey of quantifier terms in Australian languages.
    \item Australian languages are  frequently described as having ``simple'' or ``impoverished'' quantifier systems.% grammars and  extremely impoverished counting systems (`one,' `two,' `many').
    \item We show that Australian languages have a variety of quantificational expressions, contrary to this stereotype.
    \item Of particular interest is the variety of morphosyntactic strategies that Australian languages use for expressing quantificational concepts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope of our survey}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our typology is based on data from 96 published grammars or grammatical sketches on 85  Australian languages.
    
    % 96 = # of sources that have data (everything but "no")
    % this includes more than one source per language; the actual # of languages in our sample is smaller
    
    % 90 = actual # of languages surveyed so far
    \item We aim to have a sample that is genetically and areally balanced.
    \begin{itemize}
           \item Our survey currently includes languages from all Australian states/territories except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory (6/8).
           %\footnote{The Australian Capital Territory is very small (think Washington DC) and we were unable to locate relevant data on the languages that are spoken there. Linguists generally do not have very much information on Tasmanian languages. The last speaker of a Tasmanian language passed away in 1905.}
             \item The {\bf Pama-Nyungan} family contains 90\% of the languages in Australia.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There are $\sim$25-30 accepted subgroups in Pama-Nyungan (\citealt{bowernatkinson12,ogradyvoegelin66}). 
        \item Our study includes 50 Pama-Nyungan languages from 23 subgroups.
        \end{itemize}
        \item {\bf Non-Pama-Nyungan} families contain the remaining 10\% of languages in Australia; non-Pama-Nyungan languages are spoken only in northern Australia (NT and WA).
        \begin{itemize}
         \item There are $\sim$15-20 accepted families in non-Pama-Nyungan (\citealt[xv]{kn14}).
        \item Our study includes 31 non-Pama-Nyungan languages from 16 families.
        % What is our extra subgroup???
        \end{itemize}
 %   \vspace{-3mm}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.38]{pamanyunganmap1.png}
    \caption{Map of major current subgroups of Pama-Nyungan (\citealt[820]{bowernatkinson12})}
\end{figure}

   \begin{itemize} 
        \item We also include 8 language isolates (sometimes classified as isolates within either Pama-Nyungan or non-Pama-Nyungan, e.g.\ Muruwari, Wardaman) and 2 creoles.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
    \item When we report that a language ``has'' a quantifier, we mean that the source(s) that we consulted on the language describe this quantifier.
    \item We restrain from making strong claims about languages lacking certain quantificational expressions, since there may be gaps in the collected data.
    \item We instead present proportions. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each expression we discuss, we show {\bf how many languages in our sample have it / the total number of languages for which we have quantifier data.}
        \item We surveyed a total of 109 sources; of these, only 96 had quantifier data.
    \end{itemize}
    
%        \item We focused primarily on sources published after 1980 to maximize the likelihood that the sources we consulted would include information on quantifiers.
        \item We generally present data as it is given in the source: We standardize some interlinear glosses, and generally use the author's chosen orthography.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{How we define quantifiers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the purpose of this study, we do not assume a theoretical definition of quantifiers (i.e., \citealt{heimkratzer98}).
    \item {\bf We define quantifiers as lexical items that refer to quantities, typically of individuals.}  This includes:
    
    % It is really hard to give a non-theoretical definition of quantifiers!!!! Please change this as you see fit! I don't like what I wrote.

    
\begin{itemize}
        \item Terms referring to vague quantities ({\it many, few, several, ...})
        \item Terms referring to properties of sets ({\it all, some, no,} ...)
        \item Terms referring to cardinalities ({\it one, two, three}, ...)
        \item Wh-words referring to quantities  ({\it how many, how much})
        \item Indefinite pronouns ({\it someone, something, somewhere, ...})
        \item Terms referring to ``quantities'' of times ({\it always, often, sometimes...})
\end{itemize}
    \item Our study does {\bf not} include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number marking in agreement systems, e.g.\ singular, dual, or paucal agreement
    \item Non-pronominal (in)definiteness
    \item Expressions that have been theoretically argued to include quantifiers in their semantic denotations, e.g.\ modals (\citealt{heimkratzer98})
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Morphosyntactic findings}
\label{sec:mpsfind}

\subsection{Lexical categories of quantifier terms}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The vast majority of languages in our survey encode quantifier terms as nouns.\footnote{Australian languages are often described as lacking adjectives, which pattern like nouns in e.g.\ hosting case marking and triggering agreement marking. Verbs and nouns tend to be the two major lexical categories.}
    \item Like other nouns, they can host case marking and trigger agreement marking.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{allerg} \textsc{Bardi (nPN: Nyulnyulan)} (\citealt[272]{bowern12})\\
\gll Nyalaboo i-ng-arr-ala-n \textbf{boonyja}-nim.\\

many-{\sc erg}$=${\sc 3subj.pl} dig.{\sc pst} honey.ant-{\sc dat}\\
\glt `Many (people) dug for honey ants.'
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
    \item As nominals, quantifiers are frequently documented in discontinuous NPs (cf.\ \citealt[51--52]{louagieverstraete16}, who observe that in Australian languages, quantifiers are the most frequent type of modifier to occur discontinuously). However, most sources do not comment on this property.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Matngele (nPN: Eastern Daly)} (\citealt[54]{zandvoort99})\\
\gll \textbf{Nembiyu} ardiminek \textbf{binya} \textbf{jawk}.\\

% MB: I have no idea! :( I've just been copying and pasting examples directly from sources, including their weird interlinear glosses. I figured we would go back and standardize them all later, if possible.
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nominal quantifiers can also typically stand alone as arguments, without any other associated noun. % (\ref{allerg}). %@ the bardi ex above shows that, too
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Kuuku Ya'u (PN: Paman)} (\citealt[15]{thompson88})\\
\gll Ngulu         kuu'ala-ngka           \textbf{kulima}-ku.\\
3{\sc sg.nom} speak-{\sc pres.cont} many-{\sc dat}\\
\glt `He is speaking to many people.'
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item A standalone quantifier may be able to have arguments/adjuncts of its own.
\end{itemize}
\begin{exe}

  \gll miku ngayi=yi \textbf{yingamali} \textbf{Garrwa-yudi}\\
  \textsc{neg} 1\textsc{sg}=\textsc{neg.abil} one Garrwa-\textsc{with}\\
  \glt `I'm not the only one with Garrwa.'
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A much smaller number of languages (at least 5\ofy) encode quantifier terms as adverbial expressions. These occur in addition to nominal quantifiers; as far as we know, no Australian language only uses adverbial quantifiers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex {\sc Kayardild (nPN: Tangkic)} (\citealt[464]{round09})\\

\glt `The people are all watching the corroboree.'
% Round's gloss:  bakii-j- 'all do; do to all.' Sounds a little absolutive-restricted, but I don't think he explicitly says it.
%\ex \textsc{Mayali (nPN: Gunwinyguan)} (\citealt[221]{evans95})\\
%\gll Gunj barri\textbf{-bebbe}-yame-ng.\\
%kangaroo 3a\textsc{p-distr}-spear-\textsc{pp}\\
%\glt `They each killed a kangaroo.'\\
%([they]$_{key}$ [kangaroo-spear-bebbeh]$_{share}$, i.e.\ one kangaroo-killing per man) %@ oh crap, I was totally giving just an example for an A-qfr, and look what I chose at random. % MB: Hahahh, oooops, that's my bad for not noticing! I'll put it up in the A-quantifier section and we can find a new example from Mayali.
\ex {\sc Garadjari (PN: Marrngu)} (\citealt[54]{sands89})\\
\gll \textbf{wiridjardu}  nga-njari-djinja.\\
 completely  eat-{\sc cont}-3{\sc pl.O}     \\   
\glt `He ate them all up.'
% MB: I commented out the Mayali example just so we could have one PN and one nPN example!
\end{exe}



\subsection{Syntactic patterns of modification
\label{sec:scope}}
\begin{itemize}
\item In a small number of languages, quantifiers are restricted to modifying absolutive arguments (i.e.\ they associate with S and P/O arguments, but not A). %@ that's only relevant for A-quantifiers, or not only? 
% MB: I was about to write the exact same question! As far as I know, the only languages (for which I have seen both positive and negative data on this topic) that have absolutive-scope quantifiers encode them as A-quantifiers. These are Warlpiri and Mayali.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex {\sc Warlpiri (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa)} (\citealt[15]{bowler17})\\
\gll Wati-ngki \textbf{muku} rdilyki-pungu kurlarda-wati.\\
 man-{\sc erg} all/completely break.{\sc pst} spear-several\\
 \glt `The man broke all the spears.'
\ex \textsc{Mayali (nPN: Gunwinyguan)} (\citealt[233]{evans95})\\
\gll Aban-\textbf{djangged}-bukka-ng.\\
1/3\textsc{pl}-bunch-show-\textsc{pp}\\
\glt `I showed them \textbf{the whole lot}.'
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item To the best of our knowledge, this property is primarily described of adverbial quantifiers. \item However, \cite{harvey92} describes one nominal quantifier in Gaagudju, {\it geegirr}, that is preferred (but not required) in combination with absolutive arguments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex {\sc Gaagudju (nPN: Isolate)} (\citealt[307]{harvey92})\\
\gll ba-'rree-ng-ga=mba \textbf{geegirr} ma'rree-ya=mba \textbf{geegirr}.\\ 
2{\sc a-ie-fu}-take={\sc aug} all 1+2{\sc a}-go.{\sc fu=aug} all\\
\glt `I will take all of you. We will all go.'
\end{exe}

%@ also, maybe add stuff like combination with pronouns as in Urningangk `you many'?

\section{Semantic findings}
\label{sec:semfind}

\subsection{Expressing `many'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The majority (72\ofy) of languages in our survey have a lexical item that  contributes a meaning like English `many.'\footnote{Only one language in our survey, the Gooniyandi mother-in-law language, is explicitly described as lacking a word for `many' (\citealt[636]{mcgregor89}).}
    \item We find that languages frequently have more than one lexical item for `many,' in opposition to the widely popularized view that Australian languages have ``simple'' or ``impoverished'' quantifier systems.
    % Current count: 15/72
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex {\sc Yugambeh (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa)} (\citealt{sharpe98})
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textit{kamaybu} `lots of,' `plenty,' `beyond four'
\ex \textit{karal} `more,' `many,' `a lot,' `all,' `plenty'
\ex \textit{walal}  `many' 
\end{xlist} 
\ex {\sc Bardi (nPN: Nyulnyulan)} (\citealt{bowern12}) 
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textit{niimana}  `plenty,' `many'
\ex \textit{ngarri} `a lot,' `much'

\end{xlist}

\begin{xlist}
\ex  \gll Badu \textbf{bulga} inma         njagunj-djagu.\\

man  strange  many  midday  sit.down\\
\glt `A lot of strangers sat down at midday.' 
%Muɻga ‘many’ (57)
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Use of `big' to express `many'/`much' \label{bigmanysection}}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Several ($\sim$6\ofy) languages in our survey use a term for `big' to express `many'/`much.'\footnote{\citet[37]{louagieverstraete16} assert that in Gooniyandi, prenominal `big' functions as a quantifier, whereas postnominal `big' has an adjectival meaning:
    \vspace{-2mm}
    \begin{exe}
    \ex {\sc Gooniyandi (nPN: Bunuban)} (\citealt[260,265]{mcgregor90})
    \begin{xlist}
    \ex \gll \textbf{nyamani} gamba\\

\glt `a lot of water'% (McGregor 1990: 260) 
\ex \gll yoowooloo \textbf{nyamani} \\
man big \\
\glt `a big man' %(McGregor 1990: 265)
    \end{xlist}
    \end{exe}
    }
    \item This term typically occurs in combination with mass nouns and is glossed into English as `much'/`a lot.'
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Garrwa (nPN: Garrwan)} (\citealt{furby77})
\begin{xlist}
\ex \gll \textbf{walgu\v{r}a} wadjili \\

\glt `a lot of wild honey,' `much wild honey' % p. 23
\ex \gll \textbf{walgu\v{r}a}-nanji duŋala-nanji\\

\glt `from the big hill' % p. 33
\end{xlist}

water   big  3{\sc sg}-come-{\sc pres} roar-{\sc asp}\\
\glt `A lot of rain came roaring here.'
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item (At least) two languages in our survey, Kalaw Kawaw Ya and Garrwa, permit `big'  to be used with count nouns. This results in a gloss of `many.' %UPD: there's one example from Garrwa where `big' with human pl suffix also means `a big mob' (it's clear that it's not modifying a noun, i.e.\ not `the big ones') 
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textsc{Kalaw Kawaw Ya (PN: Western Torres Strait)} (\citealt[141]{fo91})\\
\gll Yan burumiya lumiz +war moebaygan nanga burum        \textbf{koeyma}    mathan.\\

%\glt `We also brought young boys from the south, child(ren), \textbf{this big mob}.' %(21.3.00.1.DmcD)
\end{exe}
%MB: I think this interlinear gloss is a little weird

\subsubsection{Other strategies for expressing `many'/`much'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item One language, Mangarayi, primarily expresses ``positive'' meanings like `many' and `much' using negative expressions of the form `not a few' or `not a little bit.'
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex {\sc Mangarayi (nPN: Isolate?)} (\citealt[37-38]{merlan89}) \\
\gll ŋi\~{n}jag \textbf{guyban} ga-ŋa-nidba.\\
{\sc prohib} little.bit 3-1{\sc sg}/3{\sc sg}-have\\
\glt `I have not a little bit,' i.e., `I have a lot.'
\end{exe}

%\subsubsection{Nominal}
%\subsubsection{Adverbial}

\subsection{Expressing `all'/`every'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Approximately half (44\ofy) of the languages in our survey have a strategy for expressing `all'/`every.'
    \item Of interest to us is the fact that the languages in our survey use a number of different strategies to express `all'/`every.'
\begin{itemize}
\item 31/44 of these languages have at least one unique lexical item that means `all'/ `every.'
    \item The remaining languages (13/44) use other strategies as their primary means of expressing universal quantification.
    
    \item The most common of these strategies are using a single lexical item to express both `many' and `all'/`every,' and morphologically deriving `all'/`every' from `many.'
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unique lexical item for `all'/`every'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Of the 44 languages that have a strategy for expressing universal quantification, 31 of them have at least one unique lexical item that expresses `all'/`every.'
     \item So far, we have not found languages  with universal quantifiers that are restricted to plural nouns (English {\it all}) or singular nouns (English {\it every}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}

\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
    %OLD: \item So far, we have not found languages that with universal quantification over pluralities (English {\it all}) (e.g.\ (\ref{univ1})) versus over single individuals (English {\it every}) (e.g.\ (\ref{univ2})).
    %NEW:
    \item Languages also do not lexically distinguish between quantification over sets of individuals (\ref{univ1}) versus over subparts of a single individual (\ref{univ2}).
    %\item So far, we have not found languages that lexically distinguish between collective and distributive universal quantification (English \textit{all} vs.\ \textit{each}), typologically manifest in plural vs.\ singular agreement %@ surely there's some Gil reference on that, let's see if I can find it
    % MB: I'm pretty certain this is the case. It would be interesting if we found counterexamples to this.

\subsubsection{Universal quantifier is expressed by same lexical item as `many'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A small number  ($\sim$6/44) of these languages have a single quantifier that can be interpreted as having either existential or universal force.
    \item Its interpretation as expressing existential or universal force is determined by context.

\subsubsection{Universal quantifier is morphologically derived from `many'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A small number ($\sim$4/44) of these languages morphologically derive a universal quantifier from the lexical item for `many' as their primary strategy for expressing universal quantification.
    \item This is typically accomplished by combining `many' with an affix meaning `only' or `still.'

    \item We also have not found any languages that make a lexical distinction akin to English `all' versus `every,' i.e., we have not found any Australian universal quantifiers that are restricted to combining with singular nouns ({\it every child}) as opposed to plural nouns ({\it all the children}).

\subsubsection{Other strategies for expressing universal quantification
\label{sec:uqbig}}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have found evidence from one language (Murrinh-Patha) for the adjective `big' being used as a universal quantifier. It is capable of mass and wholistic (\ref{ex:wholemp}) quantification, i.e.\ when the head noun is either mass or denotes an entity with understood internal structure (whether collective (\textit{herd}) or not (\textit{the whole house})).

\item We find that a quarter (22\ofy) of the languages in our survey have a strategy for expressing `some.'
\end{itemize}

\end{exe}

%MB: There's a nice example of lexical "some" in Mangarayi: Merlan 1989, p. 17!

\begin{itemize}
\item Sources for 4/22 languages suggest that the expression for `some' implies `some and not all,' akin to the scalar implicature that obtains with English {\it some}.
\item We presently hypothesize that in the languages where `some' is expressed by `other,' this partitive meaning is part of the assertion rather than a scalar implicature. However, comparison of `some' and `other' in these languages requires much further research.
% MB: I actually am not so sure that scalar implicature is the way to go with this! I think "other" can assert that there are individuals for which p is false, no? We have someone in our department who is writing her dissertation on "other," though, so I will ask her. :P (I am going to tone this down for the purpose of my talk tomorrow, but feel free to change it back when you talk at ALW.)
% VK: Cool bananas! Yeah good point, I'll need to think about it again tomorrow. Looking forward to hearing the feedback from the `other'-expert, too!
\item Finally, 4\ofy{} sources explicitly deny that the respective language has an expression for `some.'
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Expressing `no'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Over half (52\ofy) of the languages in our study have a strategy for expressing constituent negation (i.e.\ {\it no dogs}).
    \item The main two strategies for expressing constituent negation are through privative suffixes and free, uninflected lexical items.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Privative suffixes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Approximately half (24/52)  of these languages can express constituent negation with a privative suffix.
    \item Privative suffixes typically express a lack of possession; however, we also find examples of languages using privative suffixes in negative existential expressions (\ref{privexist1}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some privative suffixes are related to free lexical items expressing `nothing,' e.g.\ Nhirrpi (PN: Karnic) \textit{-pani} `{\sc priv}' and \textit{pani} `nothing' (\citealt{bw05}).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% MB: Basically all of our examples express a lack of possession; our sources typically do not give examples of things like "There is no fire." I guess this is in part because that's what's expected from a privative suffix.
% IK: there is an ex from Nhanda that is more `existential' in the spirit --- altho it's probably still reducible to an underlying possessive idea (but then again the river carries LOCative). I guess you're right, that's just what a privative is.

\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Free lexical item expressing `no'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Of the languages with a strategy for expressing constituent negation, 29/52 can use a free, uninflecting lexical item. (This may be in addition to having a privative suffix.)
    \item Over half of these 29 languages are non-Pama-Nyungan; however, Pama-Nyungan languages are also represented.
    \item We have examples of negative particles occurring both prenominally and postnominally.

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \cite{bowernzentz12} give a typology of counting systems in Australia. For now, we refer interested individuals to their paper.
    \item Most (139/189) of the languages in their sample have counting systems with upper limits of `three' or `four' unique (i.e., non-morphologically complex) numerals.
    \item 60/85 of our sources include information on counting systems. Of the languages described by these sources, at least half (30/60) have counting systems with an upper limit of `three' or `four' morphologically simple numerals.
    \item Larger numerals are typically morphologically derived through combinations of smaller numerals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item At least 15\ofy\ languages in our survey have a nominal suffix expressing `two.'\footnote{Australian languages typically have singular, plural, and dual number agreement. As such, this nominal suffix could be treated as marking dual number. Nonetheless, we choose to include it in our current study due to the interesting variability in whether this suffix is related to the free numeral `two.'}

  \item 10/38 languages have a Wh-term for `how many' that is morphologically derived from another Wh-word or has a broader meaning, including e.g.\ `how long' (Bardi root \textit{nganyji}-) (\citealt{bowern12}).
\end{itemize}

\item This prevalence of lexicalization for `how many' suggests that the concept of quantity may be more salient in Australian cultures than the received wisdom has it.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unique lexical item for `how many'}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We find that the majority (29/38) of these languages have a unique Wh-word that is used to ask `how many.'
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{`How many' morphologically derived from another Wh-word}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A smaller number of languages morphologically derive their Wh-term for `how many' from another Wh-word.
    \item These source Wh-words include \textit{what} (\ref{howmanyex1}), \textit{where} (\ref{howmanyex2}), \textit{when} (Malakmalak: nPN, Northern Daly) (\citealt[17]{tryon74}), and \textit{how} (Kuuku Ya'u: PN, Paman) (\citealt[91]{thompson88}).

  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Lexical item for `how many' has a broader meaning}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A small number of languages use a Wh-term to express `how many' that has a broader Wh-meaning, e.g.\ Warlpiri \textit{nyajangu} `how many,' `which one(s).'
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}

\subsection{Expressing indefinite pronouns, e.g.\ `someone,' `something'}
% It looks like we have way more data on 'something'/'someone' indefinites than 'anything'/'anyone' indefinites. Those also look like they pattern differently. We could consider excluding the latter, or making another subsection for them.
% MB: I completely agree! Yeah, going over this now, I realize there is a LOT to work on here. We could probably write a whole other paper just on indefinites...
\begin{itemize}
\item 34\ofy{} languages  in our survey are described as having indefinite pronouns like \textit{someone}, \textit{nothing}, \textit{anywhere}, \textit{whoever} etc.\ and ignoratives (\textit{whatchamacallit}).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The vast majority (30/34) of the  indefinite pronouns are based on Wh-words.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the majority ($\sim$23/30) of these languages, Wh-words are  ambiguous between indefinite and interrogative meanings.
  \item However, in 11/30 languages, indefinites (can) be morphologically derived from Wh-words.
  \end{itemize}
  \item In at least 5/34 languages,  indefinite pronouns can be based on generic nominals or classifiers (e.g.\ `person', `thing').
    % MB: Again, bumped this up because Warlpiri can do it. :P 
    \item At least 4/34 languages have dedicated expressions for indefinite pronouns or ignoratives (that are distinct from the Wh-words).
  % MB: I bumped this up one because Warlpiri has one!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Indefinites are expressed by  Wh-words}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sim$23/30 languages that use Wh-words to express indefinite pronouns (can) do so without adding any additional morphology.
\item Wh-expressions can therefore be ambiguous between interrogative and declarative readings.
\end{itemize}

\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Indefinites are morphologically derived from Wh-words}
\begin{itemize}
\item In 11/30 languages, indefinite pronouns can be morphologically derived from Wh-words.
    \item Indefinite pronouns are typically derived by adding an indefinite, ignorative, or dubitative affix/particle.\footnote{Interestingly, Bardi (nPN: Nyulnyulan) can express the indefinite pronoun `something' using a compound of `who' and `nose': \textit{angginimal} `something' [lit.\ \textit{anggaba} `who' + \textit{niimal} `nose'] (\citealt[321]{bowern12}). }
    \item In at least 2/30 languages, indefinite pronouns involve reduplication of Wh-words.
%    \item Arabana-Wangkangurru forms indefinite pronouns by reduplicating Wh-words.

\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Indefinites are expressed by generic nouns and classifiers \label{sec:gnindf}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item At least 5/30 languages can use generic nouns (`person,' `thing') or classifiers (\ref{indetclass1}) to express indefinite pronouns; we suspect the actual number is much higher.
\end{itemize}

\end{exe}


\subsubsection{Indefinites are expressed by dedicated lexical items
\label{sec:dili}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finally, a small number of languages in our survey have dedicated lexical items that are used to express indefinite pronouns.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
  \ex \textsc{Kalkatungu (PN: Kalkatungic)} (\citealt[104--5]{blake79})
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex \textit{\charis n̪ani} `who'; \textit{\charis n̪aka} `what'
    \ex ``The interrogatives are not used as indefinites\ldots\ \textit{\charis ŋarpa} is the indefinite `some creature'\ldots\ \textit{\charis min̪aŋara} is `something'\thinspace''
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}



\begin{itemize}
\item We have not yet systematically investigated the contexts of indefinites, their scopal properties and the different series they form.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Impressionistically, existential indefinites (`someone,' `something,' etc.) are prevailing in the descriptions, and there is less information about e.g.\ free-choice indefinites (`anyone'/`whoever').
  \item The negative indefinites (`nothing', `nowhere') are often formed by combining a negative particle with an interrogative.% (\ref{ex:mpwhi}).
  \item In Murrinh-Patha, for instance, indefinites formed by adding a suffix to a Wh-word are necessarily non-specific or unknown to the speaker, while the ones formed with the classifier (\ref{ex:mpcli}) do not have this restriction.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}


%\subsection{Temporal quantifiers}
% MB: Honestly, I think I'm just going to take this section out for the talk this week... I just don't have the time to write it up! We can put it back in for ALW, though!
% VK: sure enough! If you wish, you can still keep it just as a placeholder, sort of TBAdded --- but up to you! 

\subsection{Verb for `to count'}

\begin{itemize}
\item Although it is not a quantifier itself, we are interested in the prevalence of the verb `to count' in Australian languages. The presence of this verb suggests a familiarity with quantificational concepts like numeracy.
\item A small number (7\ofy) languages in our survey have a verb that is glossed as `to count.'

\item The actual number of languages with this verb is probably somewhat higher, since only a subset of our sources are dictionaries/include wordlists.
\item Interestingly, several of the verbs for `to count' explicitly describe physically manipulating objects or tallies for the purpose of counting.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex {\sc Pintupi (PN: Wati)} (\citealt[179]{pintupi77})\\
\textit{yiltijirripungu} `to count'/`to mark the ground'\\
(used to describe the marking of the ground with parallel marks for the purpose of counting)
\ex {\sc Nunggubuyu (nPN: Gunwinyguan)} (\citealt{heath84})
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textit{munduwa} `to examine closely and divide into piles' 
\ex \textit{ngunymaa} `to examine a pile of objects'/`to count'
%\ex \textit{rangguda} `sort into diff piles of diff quality'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe} 

\subsection{Quantifier borrowings from English}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some authors cite instances of Australian languages borrowing quantifier terms from English (see \S\ref{countingsystemsection} for examples of borrowed numeral terms).
\item In \cite{sandefur79}'s description of Ngukurr-Bamyili Creole, nearly all of the quantifier terms in the language are borrowed from English.
\item We take this as possible instances of borrowings to fill lexical gaps.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe} 
\ex {\sc Warlpiri (PN: Ngumpin-Yapa)} \\
{\it pulapi} `full' $<$ English `full up'

\ex {\sc Ngukurr-Bamyili Creole} (\citealt[100]{sandefur79})
\begin{xlist}
\ex \textit{fyu} `few'
\ex \textit{lilbit} `a little'
\ex \textit{sam, sambala} `some'
%MB: This is almost certainly a borrowing from English. The use of “pala”/”bala” (from English “fellow”) is a common cardinality suffix in other English creoles (e.g. Tok Pisin) as well as Australian languages (probably borrowed from the creoles?).
%haf - ‘half, portion’
\ex \textit{holot, holbit} `all'/`whole'
%olagija - ‘(absolutely) all’
%blandi, blandibala - ‘plenty’
%naf - ‘enough’
\ex \textit{nomo lilbit} `a lot'
%bigmob, karangnuyirringba - ‘lots, many’
\ex \textit{tumani, tumaj} `very many'/`very much'
\ex \textit{thadmaj, milyans} `an unbelievable quantity'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\section{Conclusion and wishlist}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this talk, we showed the variety of morphosyntactic strategies that Australian languages use to express quantificational concepts.
\item We make the following tentative generalizations about quantificational expressions in Australian languages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vague quantifier terms (e.g.\ `many,' `several') can combine with both mass and count nouns, unlike e.g.\ English \textit{many} versus \textit{much}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item However, the use of the adjectives `big' and `small' as quantificational expressions is typically limited to mass nouns.
\end{itemize}
\item In no Australian language have we found the morphosyntactic distinction between PL-agreeing collective universal quantifier and SG-agreeing distributive UQ, despite this being a typologically recurring pattern (while the distributive reading can be explicitly emphasized in some Australian languages). %@ ref! 
\item The use of privative suffixes to express constituent (nominal) negation is restricted almost entirely to Pama-Nyungan languages.
\item Pama-Nyungan languages are more frequently described as having Wh-terms for `how many' (whether unique or morphologically derived).
\item Indefinite pronouns can almost always be based on Wh-words, either through a single lexical item expressing both indefinite and interrogative meanings, or by morphologically deriving indefinite pronouns from Wh-words.
\end{itemize}
    \item In conclusion, we provide the following \textbf{wishlist for future descriptions of quantifiers in Australian languages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do quantifiers with existential force give rise to scalar implicatures (i.e., `some (and not all)')?
        \item What are the scope-taking ability of quantifiers; e.g., can they scope above or below negation? Can multiple quantifiers occur in a single utterance, and if so, do quantifier scope ambiguities occur?
        \item What are the historical sources of quantifier expressions? Is there evidence for speakers adapting existing lexical items to express quantificational concepts, e.g.\ possibly Pintupi \textit{yiltijirripungu} `to count'/`to mark the ground'?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
